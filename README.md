# Notes
 
A fullstack web app made in Angular and Java/Spring Boot. Final project for the Tsofen Fullstack Course

The app allows the user to create new notes, as well as view and edit existing notes, with each note having a title, body, color, and priority. The data is sent to the server and saved in a MySQL database via Spring Data JPA respositories.

The Angular frontend uses Angular Material, and uses HTTP requests to communicate with the backend controllers.
